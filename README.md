Dazer
=====

A mimimal Koa.js Hackathon Starter (currently in alpha phase).

To Use: 

    git clone https://github.com/bhanuc/dazer

    npm install
    
    node index.js
    
This Starter can only work in node v4+ and node v0.12 with the --harmony-generators or --harmony flag.

For a more humpy starter, do check out [Sahat Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter).

Main Differences with the above project:
	Based on Koa.js instead of express
	EJS instead of Jade
	No Api Examples
	Only Facebook and Local Oauth integration
	Currently No tests included
	Currently No Emails service included


## Any Kind of help would be welcomed . Just Fork and create a pull request .
